As a sociologist, my research focuses on the use and evolution of language, especially in religious contexts. My work has appeared in the *Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion*, *Poetics*, *Sociological Perspectives*, *The Sociological Quarterly*, and *Socius*. I received my PhD from the [Department of Sociology](http://sociology.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) and am currently the Director of Digital Scholarship at the [Emory Center for the Study of Law and Religion](http://cslr.law.emory.edu/).

I am passionate about data visualization, statistics, and recent developments in computational text analysis, and have led over 20 hours of training workshops in R. I also enjoy dogs, sailboats, and old-time music.
