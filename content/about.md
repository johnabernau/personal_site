I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Sociology](http://sociology.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I study how groups use language to solve social problems. My previous research has examined (1) how modern states differ in their public interpretations of national disasters, and (2) how country musicians use linguistic codes to signal group membership. In my dissertation (3) I develop a method for anchoring multiple word embedding spaces using the cosine similarity of target words. I use this to examine the American language of death and dying as it fluctuates in semantic-syntactic language space over time.

I am passionate about data visualization and research methods, and have led over 20 hours of training workshops in R. I also enjoy dogs, sailboats, and old-time music.
