<p>My new website is up! It is built by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and deployed through <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. A huge thanks to Yihui Xie and colleagues for the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown package in R</a> and the many helpful tutorials on getting started (<a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">like this one</a>). Lastly, a major shout-out to my friend and colleague <a href="https://trent.netlify.com/about/">Trent Ryan</a> for general R support and encouragement (and help with the cocoa theme!).</p>
