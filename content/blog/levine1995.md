After a missed connection in Toronto, an overnight flight, one lost suitcase, and a few hours wandering the streets looking for my Airbnb, I had about two days to explore the city before the conference. I quickly found Copenhagen’s bike lanes to be the best way to get around the city and spent a lovely morning on the streets of Nyhavn, an afternoon at the royal gardens to visit Søren Kierkegaard’s statue, and an evening on the three lakes (Søerne) of the Western edge of the city. I flew back to the United States after a long but productive day at the University of Copenhagen’s <a href="http://www.nias.ku.dk/what-nias" target="_blank">Nordic Institute for Asian Studies</a> and I look forward to sharing our work in a forthcoming publication.
