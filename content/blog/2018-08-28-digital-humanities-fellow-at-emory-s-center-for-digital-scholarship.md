This week I am excited to start my new position as the Digital Humanities Fellow at the [Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS)](http://digitalscholarship.emory.edu/). The center offers a touch-point for faculty and students working on a variety of digital projects, from interactive web design and online publication to the basics of working with video, photography, and audio in an academic setting. ECDS also partners with various academic departments, agencies, and faculty members to produce original scholarship. 

I’ve worked as a Digital Scholarship Specialist at ECDS for the past three years, [leading workshops in R](/xcode) and contributing to a number of academic projects (cf. [Holocaust Denial on Trial](https://www.hdot.org/)). As part of my new role at the center, I will join the editorial staff of [Atlanta Studies](https://www.atlantastudies.org/), an open-access web-based journal committed to advancing interdisciplinary scholarship.  I look forward to the coming year and the many exciting opportunities on the horizon!
