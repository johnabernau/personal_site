**Craciun, Mariana. 2017. “Emotions and Knowledge in Expert Work: A Comparison of Two Psychotherapies.” *American Journal of Sociology* 123(4):959–1003.**

**Summary:** The author uses ethnographic data to examine the role of emotions in the work of psychoanalysis (PA) and cognitive-behavioral (CB) therapy. She proposes a model of emotions as supportive, didactic, and inductive (an “affective-relational framework”). While both therapies use emotions, PA knowledge and/or findings don't translate well outside their discipline (i.e. to insurers). CB uses scales and tests – a mechanism much more familiar to outsiders. This is one of the reasons for its current dominance in the field - the ability to communicate results and credibility to outsiders. If the outside world is playing the evidence-based-medicine, Weberian-rationalization game, you have to play along.  

**Quote:** "By shunning the methods of evidence-based practice, PA therapists have lost ground to their better-positioned colleagues in pharmacology and CB therapy who draw on institutional sources of legitimacy." p991

**Heerwig, Jennifer A. 2017. “Money in the Middle: Contribution Strategies among Affluent Donors to Federal Elections, 1980–2008.” *American Journal of Sociology* 123(4):1004–63.**

**Summary:** Who gives money to political candidates and why? How have their strategies changed over the last few decades? Individual donors have always been (and continue to be) the most significant source of funding for candidates in federal elections. The author assembled data on over 15 million itemized contributions from the FEC disclosure records. To examine longitudinal patterns, each itemized donation had to be matched to individual donors. While each contribution entry recorded donor name, address, and occupation, these responses were not standardized over the years, presenting “a daunting number of missing values and discrepancies”: addresses changed, names were misspelled, occupations had varying descriptions, etc. The author employed a probabilistic record-matching procedure to calculate a match score based on the similarity of any two records. A clever way to get around this messy within-person variability! In short: more frequent donors are more likely to be bipartisan givers, but this contribution strategy declined over the past few decades. Previous literature has assumed individual donors to be ideologically motivated and thus more partisan, but these results suggest a more diffused, bipartisan, “access-oriented”, quid pro quo strategy. However, this strategy has declined recently, shedding light on a new angle of the oft-discussed political polarization. 

**Quote:** “Relative to the 1984 cohort, the odds of the 1990 entry year cohort ever giving to both parties decreased by 23%. The odds declined by 40% for the 1994 cohort, by 49%, for the 1996 cohort, and by 59% for the 2000 cohort.” p1025
