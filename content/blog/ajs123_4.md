**Craciun, Mariana. 2017. “Emotions and Knowledge in Expert Work: A Comparison of Two Psychotherapies.” *American Journal of Sociology* 123(4):959–1003.**

**Summary:** The author uses ethnographic data to examine the role of emotions in the work of psychoanalysis (PA) and cognitive-behavioral (CB) therapy. She proposes a model of emotions as supportive, didactic, and inductive (an “affective-relational framework”). While both therapies use emotions, PA knowledge and/or findings don't translate well outside their discipline (i.e. to insurers). CB uses scales and tests – a mechanism much more familiar to outsiders. This is one of the reasons for its current dominance in the field - the ability to communicate results and credibility to outsiders. If the outside world is playing the evidence-based-medicine, Weberian-rationalization game, you have to play along.  

**Quotes:**  
"Code switching is an important part of being a PA therapist working in a clinic. The medical record serves as a testing ground for membership in two distinct worlds: that of managed-care and evidence-based medicine and that of psychoanalysis and professional autonomy." p984  
  
"By shunning the methods of evidence-based practice, PA therapists have lost ground to their better-positioned colleagues in pharmacology and CB therapy who draw on institutional sources of legitimacy." p991
