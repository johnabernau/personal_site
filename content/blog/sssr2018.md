This year’s Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (SSSR) conference was held in Las Vegas, NV over the weekend. What a great time! It was exciting to hear about forthcoming research by Mark Chaves, David Voas, Christel Manning, Evan Stewart, and countless others. I also enjoyed getting to meet some of the people at the Pew Research Center – a bottomless source of data visualization and general inspiration.

On Saturday I presented a chapter of my dissertation titled “The (De)Institutionalization of Külber-Ross’ Five-Stage Model of Death and Dying.” [You can find the slides here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MrQlPapEE7233lNtXYW3ZcWOKjgQC2Ak/view?usp=sharing)
