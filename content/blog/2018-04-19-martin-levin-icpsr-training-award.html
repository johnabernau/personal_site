<p>Last week I was honored to receive the Martin Levin ICPSR Training Award at our annual Sociology Department awards ceremony. Marty Levin was a faculty member in the Emory University Sociology Department for many years, playing a key role in the methodological and statistical training of graduate students. Marty also served on the Board of Governors of ICPSR (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/index.jsp">Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research</a>). This award will give me the opportunity to attend a workshop over the summer and learn new methodologies for the statistical analysis of text as data. I plan to apply these new skills to my dissertation project which examines our changing language of death and dying in America. I am thankful to have such a supportive department and look forward to the workshop!</p>
