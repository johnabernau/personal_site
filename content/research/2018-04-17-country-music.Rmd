ABSTRACT: This article examines the rise of “self-references” in contemporary country music lyrics - descriptions of a ‘country’ lifestyle, specific styles of music consumption, or reference to famous artists. Using a dataset of 27,384 songs from 1989-2014, I show how these words constitute a meta-cultural practice that constructs and maintains genre boundaries, authenticity, and consecration. Becoming increasingly prevalent since the 1990s, self-references are also more likely to appear in debut albums, songs by Hall-of-Fame artists, and highly repetitive songs, while less likely to appear after Presidential elections. In sum, today’s artists use self-references to draw and perpetuate socio-cultural boundaries.
