This post tries to answer two broad questions. On the one hand, I'm curious about religious attendance by denomination over time. How has attendance fluctuated in the last eight years? Do some denominations report different rates of growth or decline? One the other hand, I'm curious about the role that empty pews play in encouraging growth or decline. Regardless of absolute size, does a *large empty* church encourage faster decline than a *small full* church? To examine these questions, I use data from the US Congregational Life Survey in 2008. To start, we'll load some packages.  

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(foreign)
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(ggplot2)
require(stargazer)
```

Then we'll grab the data from the [US Congregational Life Survey](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/CLS08PR.asp) from The ARDA Archives. I use the pre-labeled Stata (.DTA) file to save time on recoding.
```{r}
data <- read.dta("http://www.thearda.com/download/download.aspx?file=U.S.%20Congregational%20Life%20Survey,%20Wave%202,%20Random%20Sample%20Congregational%20Profile%20Survey.DTA")
```

I start by examining tabulation of denominations, saved as "denom". After constraining the denomination variable ("DENOM1") to character, I save a list of the ten largest denominations as `top10`. Lastly, I filter the dataset to only include top 10 denominations and save this as `data2`.
```{r}
denom <- arrange(count(data, DENOM1), desc(n))
denom$DENOM1 <- as.character(denom$DENOM1)
top10 <- denom$DENOM1[1:10]
data2 <- filter(data, DENOM1 %in% top10)
```

Now let's look at attendance trends. Keep in mind these rely on post-hoc estimates by head-clergy. Each year's attendance is stored as a separate variable but we'll use the `gather` function to melt the eight columns into two columns. `name` will now contain "ATTEND01", "ATTEND02", etc. and `value` will contain the number estimates for each year. This step is often confusing! Take a look at `data2` vs `data3` to see the changes. The last line puts our five variables of interest up front and arranges by `congrega` which are individual congregation codes.  

```{r}
data3 <- gather(data2, "name", "value", ATTEND08:ATTEND01)
data3 <- arrange(select(data3, 1:3, name, value, everything()), congrega)
```

Create new dataset to do our recoding...
```{r}
one <- data3
```

Recoding our yearly attendance variable. Create a new variable `date` and replace "ATTEND" with "20". This will turn "ATTEND08" into "2008". The `select` function moves this to the front of the dataset. The next line removes the "name" variable we no longer need. Lastly, convert to numeric (or date using `as.Date()`).
```{r}
one$name <- as.character(one$name)
one$date <- gsub("ATTEND", 20, one$name)
one <- select(one, 1:4, date, everything())
one <- select(one, -name)
one$date <- as.numeric(one$date)
```


Let's look at a tabulation of our denominations
```{r}
one$DENOM1 <- as.character(one$DENOM1)
count(one, DENOM1)
```


Some recoding to help our denomination names fit on our plot.
```{r}
one$DENOM1[one$DENOM1 == "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America"] <- "ELCA"
one$DENOM1[one$DENOM1 == "Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod"] <- "Missouri Synod"
one$DENOM1[startsWith(one$DENOM1, "Unitarian")] <- "Unitarian Universalist"
one$DENOM1[startsWith(one$DENOM1, "United Methodist")] <- "United Methodist"

```



An initial plot of `date` X `value` with separately colored lines for each level of `DENOM1`. Plot estimates with geom_point() and connect with geom_line(). **Importantly,** to tell R which points to connect with the line, make sure to specify that you want to group by individual congregations (`group = one$congrega`). Otherwise, R will draw a line connecting each individual ELCA congregation before moving to the next year and doing the same. For a subtle effect, I've made large congregation estimates more opaque than smaller ones using the `alpha = value` command. 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(one, aes(x = date, y = value, color = DENOM1)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = one$congrega, alpha = value)) +
  scale_alpha_continuous(guide = F) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "Avg Wkly Attend")
```

Takeaways...TOO MANY CATHOLICS!  
  
This final graph is much the same, but plots each denomination in its own pane using `facet_wrap()`, removes the color legend `scale_color...(guide=FALSE)`, and adds some annotations / theme elements. With many categories, these graphs are hard to size correctly. I've given a size that works for me and attached the plot here as a raw image file.  
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(one, aes(x = date, y = value, color = DENOM1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = one$congrega)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "black", se = F) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = F) +
  facet_wrap(~DENOM1, scales = "free", ncol = 5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Avg Wkly Attend", title = "Average Weekly Attendance (as estimated by head clergy in 2008)*", caption = "*Source: US Congregational Life Survey Wave 2\nN=5,000 US congregations") +
  theme(text=element_text(family = "Times New Roman", size = 15))

While a hasty observation would conclude that American Baptists have the steepest negative slope, a closer examination would note this trend is only based on four congregations as opposed to the hundreds of ELCA or Catholic congregations. Also notice that the Y-axis is different for each plot. The largest Roman Catholic congregation maxes out at 10,000 members(!) while the largest Unitarian Universalist maxes out at 160. A graphically subtle, but substantively important detail! Nonetheless, we can quickly get an rough idea of the attendance trends for each of these denominations over the last eight years.

Next, I want to examine the relationship between attendance and empty pews. Does a full church bring more people? Does an empty church turn people away?

We'll need a couple variables:  
  
* What is total weekly attendance?
* How many weekly services are there? 
* What is average attendance per service?
* What is the capacity of the worship space?
* Has the congregation moved to a new location recently?

Before starting on this part, let's clean up our dataset.
```{r}
new <- one %>% 
  select(DENOM1, congrega, congmovd, numbsrvc, capacity,  date, value) %>% 
  rename(total_attend = value)


```

We've already calculated the total weekly attendance as estimated over the last few years. This is saved as the `total_attend` variable. The `numbsrvc` variable tells us how many weekly services a congregation has. This ranges from 1-28. Check out the histogram below. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(new, aes(numbsrvc)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Number of Weekly Services", x = "Number of services / week")
```

Let's create average service attendance from these variables. 

```{r}
new <- new %>%
  mutate(avg_attend = total_attend / numbsrvc)
```

Next, let's create an "empty pews" measure by subtracting attendance from building capacity.

```{r}
new <- new %>%
  mutate(emptypews = capacity - avg_attend)
```


Lastly, let's use the `congmovd` variable to see whether the congregation moved to a new location within the last five years. 40 checked YES and 1592 checked NO.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
table(new$congmovd)
```

Let's try to look at our variables.
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(new, aes(avg_attend, emptypews, color = DENOM1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = one$congrega))
```

Ok, so this is clearly a negative relationship when viewed cross-sectionally: more attendance means less empty pews. But we still need to add the time dimension. How does the number of empty pews at time1 influence attendance at time2? To do this, first, we'll arrange our variables by congregation and date (ascending, or oldest first). Then group by individual congregation (`congrega`) and create two lagged empty pew variables using the handy `lag` function from dplyr. We group by congregation so that each attendance estimate stays bound to individual congregations. (*It might be interesting to see if attendance trends in one congregation influence attendance trends in another, but this is for a different time). The two lagged variables allow us to use time-series data in our predictions: do empty pews in 2007 predict attendance in 2008? Do empty pews in 2006 predict attendnace in 2008? These one- and two-year lagged variables allow us to answer these questions. 
```{r}
new <- new %>% 
  arrange(congrega, date) %>% 
  group_by(congrega) %>% 
  mutate(py_emptypews=lag(emptypews)) %>% 
  mutate(p2y_emptypews=lag(py_emptypews))

```

Getting a basic correlation from our one-year lagged variable...  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cor(new$avg_attend, new$py_emptypews, use = "complete.obs")
```

...with Pearson significance levels.
```{r}
cor.test(new$avg_attend, new$py_emptypews, method = "pearson")
```

The two-year lagged variable is much the same.
```{r}
cor.test(new$avg_attend, new$p2y_emptypews, method = "pearson")
```

Now a true test of this relationship will require a form of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) - we're trying to predict the relationship of two variables within each congregation (a level below the population sample). This procedure will have to wait for another time! But we can do some quick examinations in the mean time.

A basic scatterplot...
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(new, aes(py_emptypews, avg_attend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Logging the variables smooths the distribution...
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(new, aes(log(py_emptypews), log(avg_attend))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


A linear model doesn't tell us much, in part because we are violating the assumptions of independence. More on HLM forthcoming!

```{r}
model <- lm(log(avg_attend) ~ log(py_emptypews) + congmovd, data = new)
stargazer(model, type = "text")
```
