ABSTRACT: This article examines how artistic communities use linguistic codes to signal group membership and police boundaries. Specifically, I examine the contemporary rise of self-reflexive intertextuality in modern country music: songs about specific styles of music consumption, other canonical artists, or “country music” itself. I argue this can be understood as a response to increased genre fuzziness and rising demographic diversity among country audiences. Using an original dataset of 27,682 songs from 1989-2014, I employ dictionary-based computational text analysis to examine this theme over time and in relation to a variety of factors, include artist gender, career status, commercial success, linguistic repetition, and political environment.">

    Meta-Sounds in Modern Country Music: Lyrical Intertextuality as Boundary Work 1989-2014

<p>ABSTRACT: This article examines how artistic communities use linguistic codes to signal group membership and police boundaries. Specifically, I examine the contemporary rise of self-reflexive intertextuality in modern country music: songs about specific styles of music consumption, other canonical artists, or “country music” itself. I argue this can be understood as a response to increased genre fuzziness and rising demographic diversity among country audiences. Using an original dataset of 27,682 songs from 1989-2014, I employ dictionary-based computational text analysis to examine this theme over time and in relation to a variety of factors, include artist gender, career status, commercial success, linguistic repetition, and political environment. Becoming increasingly prevalent since 1990, intertextual themes appear most often in songs by male artists, on debut albums, and by artists <em>before</em> their induction in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Furthermore, songs on the Billboard Year-End Country charts and those with a high degree of linguistic repetition are significantly more likely to evoke intertextual themes; a relationship that only emerged in the last fifteen years. In this way, lyrical intertextuality is situated as a distinctly modern solution to a perennial social problem: how do groups construct and maintain identity boundaries within a changing social environment?</p>
