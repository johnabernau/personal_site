ABSTRACT: This article examines the rise of “self-references” in contemporary country music lyrics - descriptions of a ‘country’ lifestyle, specific styles of music consumption, or reference to famous artists. Using a dataset of 27,384 songs from 1989-2014, I show how these words constitute a meta-cultural practice that constructs and maintains genre boundaries, authenticity, and consecration. Becoming increasingly prevalent since the 1990s, self-references are also more likely to appear in debut albums, songs by Hall-of-Fame artists, and highly repetitive songs, while less likely to appear after Presidential elections.</description>

ABSTRACT: While events are central to the sociology of the state, natural disasters, a type of events with substantive and theoretical significance, have received scant attention. To address this gap, we theorize states’ cultural response to disasters—how states use discourses and actions to address moral and political meanings of death and suffering. We borrow insights from a few strands of scholarship: the sociology of disaster, cultural sociology of the state, and cultural theories of trauma and theodicy.</description>
