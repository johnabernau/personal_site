ABSTRACT: This article examines how artistic communities use linguistic codes to signal group membership and police boundaries. Specifically, I examine the contemporary rise of self-reflexive intertextuality in modern country music: songs about specific styles of music consumption, other canonical artists, or “country music” itself. I argue this can be understood as a response to increased genre fuzziness and rising demographic diversity among country audiences. Using an original dataset of 27,682 songs from 1989-2014, I employ dictionary-based computational text analysis to examine this theme over time and in relation to a variety of factors, include artist gender, career status, commercial success, linguistic repetition, and political environment.</description>

ABSTRACT: While events are central to the sociology of the state, natural disasters, a type of events with substantive and theoretical significance, have received scant attention. To address this gap, we theorize states’ cultural response to disasters—how states use discourses and actions to address moral and political meanings of death and suffering. We borrow insights from a few strands of scholarship: the sociology of disaster, cultural sociology of the state, and cultural theories of trauma and theodicy.</description>
