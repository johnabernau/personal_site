      <description>Last week I was honored to receive the Martin Levin ICPSR Training Award at our annual Sociology Department awards ceremony. Marty Levin was a faculty member in the Emory University Sociology Department for many years, playing a key role in the methodological and statistical training of graduate students. Marty also served on the Board of Governors of ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research). This award will give me the opportunity to attend a workshop over the summer and learn new methodologies for the statistical analysis of text as data.</description>

      <description>My new website is up! It is built by Hugo and deployed through Netlify. A huge thanks to Yihui Xie and colleagues for the blogdown package in R and the many helpful tutorials on getting started (like this one). Lastly, a major shout-out to my friend and colleague Trent Ryan for general R support and encouragement (and help with the cocoa theme!).
