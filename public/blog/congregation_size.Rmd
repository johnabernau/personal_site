This post uses data from the US Congregational Life Survey in 2008 to examine trends in congregation size across the ten largest American Christian denominations. Longitudinal trends rely on post-hoc estimates by head-clergy. To start, we'll load some packages. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(foreign)
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(ggplot2)
```

Then we'll grab the data from the [US Congregational Life Survey](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/CLS08PR.asp) from The ARDA Archives. I use the pre-labeled Stata (.DTA) file to save time on recoding.
```{r}
data <- read.dta("/Users/johnbernau/Desktop/uscl2008.DTA")
```

Start by examining tabulation of denominations, constrain this variable to character, and then save a list of the ten largest denominations as `top10`. Lastly, filter dataset to only include top 10 denominations. Save this as `data2`.
```{r}
denom <- arrange(count(data, DENOM1), desc(n))
denom$DENOM1 <- as.character(denom$DENOM1)
top10 <- denom$DENOM1[1:10]
data2 <- filter(data, DENOM1 %in% top10)
```

Then we'll use the `gather` function to melt the eight years of attendance estimates into two columns. `name` will now contain "ATTEND01", "ATTEND02", etc. and `value` will contain the number estimates for each year. This step is often confusing! Take a look at `data2` vs `data3` to see the changes. The last line puts our five variables of interest up front and arranges by `congrega` which are individual congregation codes.
```{r}

data3 <- gather(data2, "name", "value", ATTEND08:ATTEND01)
data3 <- arrange(select(data3, 1:3, name, value, everything()), congrega)
```

Create new dataset to do our recoding...
```{r}
one <- data3
```

Recoding our yearly attendance variable. Create a new variable `date` and replace "ATTEND" with "20". This will turn "ATTEND08" into "2008". The `select` function moves this to the front of the dataset. Convert to numeric (or date using `as.Date()`).
```{r}
one$name <- as.character(one$name)
one$date <- gsub("ATTEND", 20, one$name)
one <- select(one, 1:4, date, everything())
one$date <- as.numeric(one$date)
```


Let's look at a tabulation of our denominations
```{r}
one$DENOM1 <- as.character(one$DENOM1)
count(one, DENOM1)
```


Some recoding to help our denomination names fit on our plot.
```{r}
one$DENOM1[one$DENOM1 == "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America"] <- "ELCA"
one$DENOM1[one$DENOM1 == "Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod"] <- "Missouri Synod"
one$DENOM1[startsWith(one$DENOM1, "Unitarian")] <- "Unitarian Universalist"
one$DENOM1[startsWith(one$DENOM1, "United Methodist")] <- "United Methodist"

```



An initial plot of `date` X `value` with separately colored lines for each level of `DENOM1`. Plot estimates with geom_point() and connect with geom_line(). **Importantly,** to tell R which points to connect with the line, make sure to specify that you want to group by individual congregations (`group = one$congrega`). Otherwise, R will draw a line connecting each individual ELCA congregation before moving to the next year and doing the same. For a subtle effect, I've made large congregation estimates more opaque than smaller ones using the `alpha = value` command. 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(one, aes(x = date, y = value, color = DENOM1)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = one$congrega, alpha = value)) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "Avg Wkly Attend")
```

Takeaways...TOO MANY CATHOLICS!  
This final graph is much the same, but plots each denomination in its own pane using `facet_wrap()`, removes the color legend `scale_color...(guide=FALSE)`, and adds some annotations / theme elements. With many categories, these graphs are hard to size correctly. I've given a size that works for me and attached the plot here as a raw image file.  
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(one, aes(x = date, y = value, color = DENOM1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = one$congrega)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "black", se = F) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = F) +
  facet_wrap(~DENOM1, scales = "free", ncol = 5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Avg Wkly Attend", title = "Average Weekly Attendance (as estimated by head clergy in 2008)*", caption = "*Source: US Congregational Life Survey Wave 2\nN=5,000 US congregations") +
  theme(text=element_text(family = "Times New Roman", size = 15))

To work on...

```{r}
# Create "empty pews" measure
one2 <- one %>% 
  mutate(emptypews = capacity - value) %>% 
  select(1:6, emptypews, everything())

# But there is weird stuff. Like the capacity is the 2008 building and they're asked to measure attendance 7 years ago. Maybe they moved buildings, get weird negative empty pew measures. 
one2 <- one2 %>% 
  filter(emptypews >= 0)
```
