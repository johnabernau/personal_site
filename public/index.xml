      <description>One of the biggest advantages of R over other statistical programs is the ability to work with text data. In the post, I cover the same four tasks using two types of text data: 
Raw Text Objects
 Cleaning text Calculating vocabulary metrics Removing stopwords Calculating basic sentiment scores  Text within Data Frames
 Cleaning text Calculating vocabulary metrics Removing stopwords Calculating basic sentiment scores  There are many great resources for learning text analysis in R, including quanteda’s extensive documentation and Silge &amp;amp; Robinson’s Text Mining with R.</description>

      <description>This year’s Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (SSSR) conference was held in Las Vegas, NV over the weekend. What a great time! It was exciting to hear about forthcoming research by Mark Chaves, David Voas, Christel Manning, Evan Stewart, and countless others. I also enjoyed getting to meet some of the people at the Pew Research Center – a bottomless source of data visualization and general inspiration.</description>

      <description>This post offers an example of data exploration in R. I will cover the following topics:
 Importing data Preparing data Plotting data v.1 Standardizing Variables Plotting data v.2 Conclusion  More specifically, I will be using data from the US Congregational Life Survey, to examine how American church attendance has fluctuated between 2001 - 2008. These trends are an important part of any contemporary understanding of religiosity, and especially relevant when considering America’s role as a “religious outlier” in the global landscape (Berger et al.</description>

      <title>Why Read Generalist Journals?</title>

      <description>Word Count: 1334 Sociology is a broad discipline. As the general “social science” it overlaps considerably with history, anthropology, political science, and economics, not to mention African American Studies, Women’s Gender and Sexuality Studies, Communication Studies, et al. While some see this breadth as a positive attribute, the dangers of a fragmented discipline are hard to ignore. As Stinchcombe (2001) argues, sociologists do not agree on the appropriate subject matter nor the way to measure it.</description>

      <description>This week I am excited to start my new position as the Digital Humanities Fellow at the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (ECDS). The center offers a touch-point for faculty and students working on a variety of digital projects, from interactive web design and online publication to the basics of working with video, photography, and audio in an academic setting. ECDS also partners with various academic departments, agencies, and faculty members to produce original scholarship.</description>

      <description>In this post I perform some data exploration in R. I’ll cover the following topics:
 Importing data Preparing data Merging data Plotting data Appendix: A 10-line code summary  More specifically, I’ll be using the World Bank data on extreme poverty to plot global trends of 162 countries between 1977 to 2016. While sociologists talk about inequality at length, it’s useful to remember the state of poverty on a global perspective.</description>

      <description>Craciun, Mariana. 2017. “Emotions and Knowledge in Expert Work: A Comparison of Two Psychotherapies.” American Journal of Sociology 123(4):959–1003.
Summary: The author uses ethnographic data to examine the role of emotions in the work of psychoanalysis (PA) and cognitive-behavioral (CB) therapy. She proposes a model of emotions as supportive, didactic, and inductive (an “affective-relational framework”). While both therapies use emotions, PA knowledge and/or findings don&amp;rsquo;t translate well outside their discipline (i.</description>

 Word Count: 1981 The Marriage-Go-Round is an outstanding example of sociological scholarship. Andrew Cherlin combines history, theory, and data to provide a thorough understanding of marriage as an organizing force of American social life. Beginning in colonial America of the 17th century, the book follows the institution of marriage through its turbulent ride to the present.</description>

 Word Count: 1929 “Is there still anything to live for? Is anything worth pursuing, apart from money, love, and caring for one’s own family? Is so, what could it be?” Like any prospective reader, I was drawn in. Who doesn’t want a philosophically sound argument for how to live one’s life?</description>

      <description>Last week I was honored to receive the Martin Levin ICPSR Training Award at our annual Sociology Department awards ceremony. Marty Levin was a faculty member in the Emory University Sociology Department for many years, playing a key role in the methodological and statistical training of graduate students. Marty also served on the Board of Governors of ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research). This award will give me the opportunity to attend a workshop over the summer and learn new methodologies for the statistical analysis of text as data.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Emory University. I study how groups use language to solve social problems. My previous research has examined (1) how modern states differ in their public interpretations of national disasters, and (2) how country musicians use linguistic codes to signal group membership. In my dissertation (3) I develop a method for anchoring multiple word embedding spaces using the cosine similarity of target words.</description>

      <description>In this post, I’ll be using R to download, clean, and plot some basic information about the regional concentration of American denominations using the Baylor Religion Survey of 2010.
To begin, make sure to load a few basic packages.
require(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;psych&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;car&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;RColorBrewer&amp;quot;) The dataset I will be using comes from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey (2010), a nationally representative survey of more than 1,500 American adults. It’s hosted on The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA).</description>

Adding Text Labels When adding text to a plot, geom_text works like many other geoms in ggplot. Below, using the mpg dataset, we’ve taken a scatterplot of fuel efficiency and added labels to show the manufacturer of each vehicle.</description>

A huge thanks to Yihui Xie and colleagues for the blogdown package in R and the many helpful tutorials on getting started (like this one). For general R / data / blogging inspiration, check out Julia Silge’s and David Robinson’s websites, as well as the editorial team at The Pudding who put together beautiful data-visualization-driven essays. Lastly, a major shout-out to my friend and colleague Trent Ryan for general R support and encouragement (and help with the cocoa theme!</description>
