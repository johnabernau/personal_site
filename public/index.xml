      <description>Last week I was honored to receive the Martin Levin ICPSR Training Award at our annual Sociology Department awards ceremony. Marty Levin was a faculty member in the Emory University Sociology Department for many years, playing a key role in the methodological and statistical training of graduate students. Marty also served on the Board of Governors of ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research). This award will give me the opportunity to attend a workshop over the summer and learn new methodologies for the statistical analysis of text as data.</description>

      <title>Empty Pews: Longitudinal Trends in U.S. Congregation Size</title>

      <description>This post uses data from the US Congregational Life Survey in 2008 to examine trends in congregation size across the ten largest American Christian denominations. Keep in mind longitudinal trends rely on post-hoc estimates by head-clergy. To start, we’ll load some packages.
require(foreign) require(dplyr) require(tidyr) require(ggplot2) Then we’ll grab the data from the US Congregational Life Survey from The ARDA Archives. I use the pre-labeled Stata (.DTA) file to save time on recoding.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Emory University. My research focuses on the ways people use language to solve social problems. One of my main research agendas revolves around death in our society. I have interviewed hospital and hospice chaplains and staff to explore the types of conversations people have surrounding death and suffering. I also have used nationally representative survey data to explore what factors predict death anxiety among older adults.</description>

Adding Text Labels When adding text to a plot, geom_text works like many other geoms in ggplot. Below, using the mpg dataset, we’ve taken a scatterplot of fuel efficiency and added labels to show the manufacturer of each vehicle.</description>

      <title>Meta-Sounds in Modern Country Music: Lyrical Self-References and Boundary Work 1989-2014</title>

      <description>John A. Bernau
ABSTRACT: This article examines the rise of “self-references” in contemporary country music lyrics - descriptions of a ‘country’ lifestyle, specific styles of music consumption, or reference to famous artists. Using a dataset of 27,384 songs from 1989-2014, I show how these words constitute a meta-cultural practice that constructs and maintains genre boundaries, authenticity, and consecration. Becoming increasingly prevalent since the 1990s, self-references are also more likely to appear in debut albums, songs by Hall-of-Fame artists, and highly repetitive songs, while less likely to appear after Presidential elections.</description>

      <description>In this post, I’ll be using R to download, clean, and plot some basic descriptive stats about the regional concentration of American denominations using the Baylor Religion Survey of 2010.
To begin, make sure to load a few basic packages.
require(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;psych&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;car&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;RColorBrewer&amp;quot;) The dataset I will be using comes from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey (2010), a nationally representative survey of more than 1,500 American adults. It’s hosted on The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA).</description>

      <description>Syllabus PDF
This course offers an introduction to the sociological study of religion. As a discipline, sociology blends theory, history, and carefully collected data to better understand social phenomenon. This perspective offers the best chance at understanding the complex phenomenon we know as religion.  We will look at classical theorists like Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber to see if their 150-year-old ideas can help us understand religion today: Would Karl Marx and MLK get along?</description>

      <description>My new website is up! It is built by Hugo and deployed through Netlify. A huge thanks to Yihui Xie and colleagues for the blogdown package in R and the many helpful tutorials on getting started (like this one). For general R / data / blogging inspiration, check out Julia Silge’s and David Robinson’s websites, as well as the editorial team at The Pudding who put together beautiful data-visualization-driven essays. Lastly, a major shout-out to my friend and colleague Trent Ryan for general R support and encouragement (and help with the cocoa theme!</description>

      <title>The Sympathetic Leviathan: How Do Modern States Culturally Respond to Disasters</title>

ABSTRACT: While events are central to the sociology of the state, natural disasters, a type of events with substantive and theoretical significance, have received scant attention. To address this gap, we theorize states’ cultural response to disasters—how states use discourses and actions to address moral and political meanings of death and suffering. We borrow insights from a few strands of scholarship: the sociology of disaster, cultural sociology of the state, and cultural theories of trauma and theodicy.</description>
