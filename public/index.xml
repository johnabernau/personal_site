      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Emory University . My research focuses on the ways people use language to solve social problems. One of my main research agendas revolves around death in our society. I have interviewed hospital and hospice chaplains and staff to explore the types of conversations people have surrounding death and suffering. I also have used nationally representative survey data to explore what factors predict death anxiety among older adults.</description>

Part 4 includes:
1. Adding text labels
2. Facet wrap / grid
3. Editing theme elements
4. Exercise 6, 7, 8
# install.packages(&amp;quot;psych&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;psych&amp;quot;) # install.packages(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;) # install.packages(&amp;quot;RColorBrewer&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;RColorBrewer&amp;quot;) # install.packages(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) require(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) 1. Adding Text Labels When adding text to a plot, geom_text works like many other geoms in ggplot. Below, using the mpg dataset, we’ve taken a scatterplot of fuel efficiency and added labels to show the manufacturer of each vehicle.</description>

      <title>The Sympathetic Leviathan How Do Modern States Culturally Respond to Disasters</title>

ABSTRACT: While events are central to the sociology of the state, natural disasters, a type of events with substantive and theoretical significance, have received scant attention. To address this gap, we theorize states’ cultural response to disasters—how states use discourses and actions to address moral and political meanings of death and suffering. We borrow insights from a few strands of scholarship: the sociology of disaster, cultural sociology of the state, and cultural theories of trauma and theodicy.</description>

      <description>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.
Bool True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do.</description>

      <description>Part One One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
 The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <title>Use @ instead of HEAD</title>
      <link>/blog/use-at-instead-of-head/</link>

      <guid>/blog/use-at-instead-of-head/</guid>
      <description>I recently discovered that from git version 1.8.5 onwards, @ can replace HEAD:
$ git reset --hard @~2 $ git rebase -i @~10 $ git diff @~2..@~3  And also in most scenarios HEAD can be left out completely, so you can say:
$ git reset -- @{2}  instead of:
$ git reset -- HEAD@{2}  It takes some getting used to, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely faster than typing HEAD.</description>
