      <description>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Emory University . My research focuses on the ways people use language to solve social problems. One of my main research agendas revolves around death in our society. I have interviewed hospital and hospice chaplains and staff to explore the types of conversations people have surrounding death and suffering. I also have used nationally representative survey data to explore what factors predict death anxiety among older adults.</description>
